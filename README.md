# Machine Learning Playground

This repo is a place where I play around with machine learning algorithms to get an understanding of how they work and how to implement them with standard ML libraries. This may cover classic statistical models, deep learning and topics from DSP which are not traditionally considered ML but fit could fit here anyway such as ARMA models (if enough of the DSP stuff accumulates then I may refactor this out into its on repo).

**CNNs**

**RNNs**

**Autoencoders**

**Model categories to explore in the future:** Transformers, GANs, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Regression Models, Classification Models, Clustering Models, Dimensionality Reduction, Reinforcement Learning, ARMA models

**Areas to do comparitive studies on:** Optimisation algorithms, regularisation, loss functions, one-shot learning

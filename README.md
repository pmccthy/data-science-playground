# Data Science Playground

This repo is a place where I play around with machine learning models and digital signal processing algorithms to get an understanding of how they work and how to implement them with standard libraries. This includes classic statistical models, probabilistic models, deep learning, and DSP concepts and algorithms. As this grows, I may refactor it out into two repos to separate the ML and DSP content, but for now it is intermixed. This repo focuses on practical implementation rather than fleshing out the mathematical details of the ML techniques used here. For learning ML theory, I have used the textbook _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ by Christopher Bishop, a free copy of which can be found [here](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf). The Bishop book focuses on understand ML from the foundations of probability theory and statistics, but doesn't include much deep learning. A good textbook for deep learning is _Deep Learning_ by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, which can be found [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

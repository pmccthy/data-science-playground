# Machine Learning Playground

This repo is a place to play around with machine learning models to get an understanding of how they work and practical experience of implementing them.

**CNNs**

**RNNs**

**Other categories to explore in the future:** Transformers, GANs, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Regression Models, Classification Models, Clustering Models, Dimensionality Reduction, Reinforcement Learning

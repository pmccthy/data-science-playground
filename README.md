# Machine Learning Playground

This repo is a place where I play around with machine learning algorithms to get an understanding of how they work and practical experience of implementing them. This may include classic statistical models, deep learning and topics from DSP which are not really ML but sort of fit in here anyway such as ARMA models (if enough of the DSP stuff accumulates then I may refactor this out into its on repo).

Below I will list the files containing each of the models I build, under the subheading of the class of model they fall into. Within each folder, there will be a markdown file with an explanation of the theory (written by myself as an exercise in understanding it) and links to resources which I have used to help me build each of the models and which explain the mathematical foundations of each of the kinds of model.

**CNNs**

**RNNs**

**Model categories to explore in the future:** Transformers, GANs, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Regression Models, Classification Models, Clustering Models, Dimensionality Reduction, Reinforcement Learning, ARMA models

**Areas to do comparitive studies on:** Optimisation algorithms, regularisation, loss functions, one-shot learning

# Machine Learning Playground

This repo is a place where I play around with machine learning algorithms (including both classical and deep learning models) to get an understanding of how they work and practical experience of implementing them.

Below I will list the files containing each of the models I build, under the subheading of the class of model they fall into. Within each folder, there will be a markdown file with an explanation of the theory (written by myself as an exercise in understanding it) and links to resources which I have used to help me build each of the models and which explain the mathematical foundations of each of the kinds of model.

**CNNs**

**RNNs**

**Model categories to explore in the future:** Transformers, GANs, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Regression Models, Classification Models, Clustering Models, Dimensionality Reduction, Reinforcement Learning

**Areas to do comparitive studies on:** Optimisation algorithms, regularisation, loss functions, one-shot learning

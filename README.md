# Data Science Playground

This repo is a place where I play around with machine learning and digital signal processing to get an understanding of how they work and how to implement them with standard libraries. This includes classic statistical models, probabilistic models, deep learning, and DSP concepts and algorithms. As this grows, I may refactor it out into two repos to separate the ML and DSP content, but for now it is intermixed.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

* [CNNs/vanilla_cnn.ipynb](CNNs/vanilla_cnn.ipynb): Generic CNN architectures

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

* [RNNs/vanilla_rnn.ipynb](RNNs/vanilla_rnn.ipynb): Generic RNN architectures
* [RNNs/lstm.ipynb](RNNs/lstm.ipynb): RNNs which use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks

## Autoencoders

* [autoencoders/vanilla_autoencoder.ipynb](autoencoders/vanilla_autoencoder.ipynb): Generic autoencoder architecture

## Model categories to explore in the future

* Transformers
* GANs
* Probabilistic Graphical Models
